Sustainability Considerations for Clinical and Translational Research Informatics Infrastructure
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
instructions_2,rc_survey_1,,descriptive,"<u>Quick Recap</u>
Current efforts are focused on two aims that we have been doing iteratively in our meetings
1. Enumerate, define, and categorize the various informatics resources (almost done) - Last steps for polishing this step should include links to examples and references
2. Elicit comments from the group about sustainability considerations for each category of resources

<u>Note:</u> We have organized the various resources that came up into Categories and those in turn into Major Headings. On a recent call we realized that discussing sustainability for each resource type may be redundant and that the sustainability considerations would be better conveyed if coalesced into the ""Category"" level.

<u>Some Definitions:</u>
Informatics: The informatics core, service, center or institute (including a CRIO) that gets some funding from the CTSA for any Informatics activity.
IT or CIO: Information Systems, Information Technology Department under the CIO either at the Health system or hospital system, or university or college.
Research Office: Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, Clinical Research Office, VP for Research Office.
