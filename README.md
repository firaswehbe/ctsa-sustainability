# Code for Sustainable Informatics Infrastructure WG

## Instructions

1. Download your *full* export from REDCap and save it as `input/survey.csv`
2. Make sure your project or environment working directory is the root of this code tree
3. Source `basic_dataprep.R` script

That's it! All output will be in `output/` directory

If you want to instantiate the survey to replicate this workflow, the REDCap data dictionary
is saved in the root directory as `DataDictionary.csv`
